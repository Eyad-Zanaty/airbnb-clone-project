## Database Design

### Users
- `id`
- `username`
- `email`
- `password_hash`

### Properties
- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `price_per_night`
- `owner_id` (ForeignKey to Users)

### Bookings
- `id`
- `user_id` (ForeignKey to Users)
- `property_id` (ForeignKey to Properties)
- `check_in_date`
- `check_out_date`

### Reviews
- `id`
- `user_id` (ForeignKey to Users)
- `property_id` (ForeignKey to Properties)
- `rating`
- `comment`

### Payments
- `id`
- `booking_id` (ForeignKey to Bookings)
- `amount`
- `payment_date`
- `status`

#### Relationships

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures secure access and allows personalization of the user experience.

### Property Management
Users can create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details like title, description, price, and images.

### Booking System
Users can book available properties for specific dates. This module handles date validation, availability checks, and booking history.

### Review System
After booking, users can leave reviews on properties. This adds credibility to listings and helps other users make decisions.

### Payment Integration
Secure payment processing is integrated with each booking. Ensures a smooth and safe financial transaction between users and the platform.

## API Security

### Authentication
Uses secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT or session-based auth) to verify user identity.

### Authorization
Restricts access to resources based on user roles and ownership, ensuring that only authorized users can edit or delete data.

### Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests from a user/IP in a given time window.

**Why security is important:**
- Protects sensitive user data like emails and passwords.
- Ensures that financial transactions are safe and reliable.
- Prevents misuse or unauthorized access to system features.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD pipelines automate testing, building, and deployment processes. They help maintain code quality, catch bugs early, and deliver new features faster.

**Tools:**
- GitHub Actions: Automate testing, linting, and deployment.
- Docker: Ensures consistent environments across development and production.
- AWS / Render / Railway: For automated and reliable deployment.
